## Project Talker Manager :speaking_head:

In this project, an application was built to register talkers (speakers) where it is possible to register, view, search, edit, and delete information.

- An API was developed for a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) of talkers
- Several endpoints were developed to read and write to a file using the fs module.

## :wrench:  Setup

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:crisnabto/TalkerManager.git
```

  <summary><strong>üêã Running on Docker vs Locally</strong></summary><br />
  
  ## On Docker

  > :information_source: Run the `node` service with the command `docker-compose up -d`.
  
  - These services will initialize a container named `talker_manager`.
  
  - From here you can run the `talker_manager` container via CLI or open it in VS Code..
  
  > :information_source: Use the command `docker exec -it talker_manager bash`.

  - It will give you access to the interactive terminal of the container created by compose, which is running in the background.

  > :information_source:  Install dependencies [**If any**] with `npm install` 
  
  > :information_source:  Execute the application with `npm start` or `npm run dev` 
    
  - **‚ö† Attention:** If you choose to use Docker, **ALL** commands available in `package.json` (npm start, npm test, npm run dev, ...) must be executed **INSIDE** the container, i.e., in the terminal that appears after executing the `docker exec` command mentioned above.

  ## Without Docker
